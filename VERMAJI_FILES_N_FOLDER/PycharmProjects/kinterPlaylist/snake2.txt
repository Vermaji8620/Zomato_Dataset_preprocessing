These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless
 lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack,
 although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, 
and Pygopodidae).Living snakes are found on every continent except
 Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include
 some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian
 archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small 
islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans.[4] Additionally,
 sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans.
 More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about
 520 genera and about 3,900 species.[5] They range in size from the tiny,
 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake[6] to the reticulated pyt
