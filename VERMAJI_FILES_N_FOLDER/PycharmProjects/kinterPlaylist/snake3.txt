Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing 
or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, 
with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 
167 Ma ago.[9][10] The diversity of modern snakes appeared 
during the Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the 
Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). The oldest preserved
 descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have 
venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for 
self-defense. Some possess venom that is potent enough to 
cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes
 either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
